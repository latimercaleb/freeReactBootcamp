# Free React Bootcamp
There was a free react bootcamp held by Tyler McGinnis over [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWX9jswdDQ0UBomCcRAcocWJqC1QtdZm5)  about React and had some basic exercises to get exposed to:
* ReactApi
* ReactDom
* ReactRouter

This repo contains my implementation of the projects assigned
